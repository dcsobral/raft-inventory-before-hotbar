# Raft Mod

In normal Raft when items are moved into a player's inventory, whether by harvesting, looting or
shift clicking, they go first to the hotbar and only if the hotbar is full they'll go into the
inventory. This mod inverts the preference between these two so that items will only be moved into
the hotbar if there are no more empty slots in the inventory. Note that this does not affect at
all the ability to move items between inventory and hotbar with a shift click.
